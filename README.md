# 2048 Game with Turtle Graphics

This project is a simple implementation of the classic 2048 game using Python's Turtle graphics library. 


## How to Play

1. Run the `play.py` file using Python.
2. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the tiles on the board.
3. The game ends when no more moves are possible, and your score is displayed.


- The maximum score achieved during a game session is stored in a file named "max_score".
